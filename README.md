## Introduction
PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development. Fast, flexible, and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your blog to the most popular websites in the world.

## Installation
To start using PHP, you need to install it on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. **Download PHP**: Visit the [official PHP website](https://www.php.net/downloads) and download the latest version for your operating system.
2. **Install PHP**: Follow the installation instructions for your specific OS.
3. **Verify Installation**: Open your terminal or command prompt and type `php -v` to check the installed version.

## Basic Syntax
Here is a simple PHP script to get you started:

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, World!";
echo "<h1>Hello world </h1>"
?>
```

Save this code in a file with a `.php` extension, for example, `hello.php`.

## Running PHP Scripts
To run your PHP script, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your script is saved. Then, type the following command:

```sh
php hello.php
```

You should see the output `Hello, World!`.
